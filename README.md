# WitnessComplex

## Installation 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrBellamonte/WitnessComplex
cd WitnessComplex
pip --no-cache-dir install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

The module has two functionalities
- Computation of a simplicial complex (computes a simplex_tree from ghudi)
- Computation of filtration values for all landmark pairs (i.e. the entire 1-skeleton)

Note: The computation of the simplicial complex is rather inefficient at this point.

### Example

```python
tensor = torch.
```
